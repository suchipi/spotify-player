alsa stuff
- Check devices with `aplay -l` and `arecord -l`
- Add loopback device with `sudo modprobe snd-aloop`
- Loopback loops eg. hw:0,0,0 to hw:0,1,0. Default playback device is hw:0,0,0, so use hw:0,1,0 to get virtual "speakers" output as an input device
- Use `cava` to visualize output, but it gets exclusive access to the device, so you can't use it while using eg ffmpeg
- cava is configured to show hw:0,1,0 in ~/.config/cava/config

running repl
- export DISPLAY=:0.0
- in another terminal: `Xvfb :0`
- Use `nvm use 10` to get node
- `node repl.js` will open Chrome in xvfb
- Use `sudo x11vnc -rfbauth ~/.vnc/passwd` to launch vnc server if you want to see the xvfb screen

recording alsa output with ffmpeg
- `ffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:0,1,0 -t 1 output.wav`
- ffmpeg must be compiled with alsa support. There's one in ~/bin that is
